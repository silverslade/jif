JIF is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), written entirely in Java, for the creation of text adventures based on Graham Nelson's Inform standard. With JIF it's possible to edit, compile and run a text adventure in the z-code and glulx formats.

Inform 7 has been developed with a new Integrated Editor but JIF can be used in any

The project has started in the 2003 and now it's in a stable state for production.
